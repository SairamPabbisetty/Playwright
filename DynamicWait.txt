await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
        
This Playwright command waits until there are no more network requests for a brief period.
Sometimes a page might look visually ready, but it's still loading scripts, images, or making API calls in the background.
'networkidle' ensures that no more network requests are being made before proceeding to the next step.

Alternative loads 

'domcontentloaded' - Waits until the DOM is fully loaded, but may still be fetching external resources
'load' - Waits until the whole page, including styles, images, and scripts, has loaded
'networkidle' - Waits until there are no active network requests for a short period 
------------------------

------------------------
await page.locator(".card-body a").waitFor();

page.locator(".card-body a") → Finds all <a> elements inside an element with the .card-body class.

waitFor() → Waits for at least one matching element to appear before proceeding.

When should you use waitFor()?
If the element is not immediately available when the page loads.
If it appears dynamically after an event, like an API response or user interaction.
